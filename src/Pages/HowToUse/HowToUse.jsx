      <h2>The Robin Hood Taxation System</h2>
      <p className='text'>
        The Robin Hood Taxation System allows you as a user to tax the worldâ€™s
        richest and watch as the money moves directly to the people at the
        lowest income levels. It is a progressive taxation system where you as a
        user control the <b>marginal rate of taxation</b> for five different
        income brackets.
      </p>
      <h2>What is Marginal Tax? </h2>
      <p className='text'>
        Marginal tax is the amount of tax that applies to each additional level
        of income. In our progressive tax system, people pay more in taxes as
        your income increases and a portion of your income moves into a higher
        tax bracket.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <b>For example</b>, if the tax rate is set to 10% for incomes between 100-1K
        per day, and 15% for incomes between 1K-10K per day, then a person with
        a daily income of $8 K will pay 10 percent in taxes on income up to $1K
        and 15 % on the remaining $7K that falls into the 15 % bracket.
      </p>
      <h2>Income Levels</h2>
      <p className='text'>
      Below the chart, there are markings which divide the world population into 
      13 different income levels. These levels are based on the income levels from Gapminder,
      and more information about this sectioning can be found <a href='https://www.gapminder.org/fw/income-levels/ '>here</a>
      </p>

      <h2>Different Vizualisations</h2>
      <p className='text'>
      Our chart offers two different types of vizualisations of the world's wealth distribution. 
      You can switch between the two vizualisations by toggling the title on the y-axis.
      When <b>Population</b> is toggled, the chart shows the number of people that has a specific income 
      of $/day.
      When <b>Total Income</b> is toggled, the chart shows the precentage of total income (per day)
      which a specific income per day is.
