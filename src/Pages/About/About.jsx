        The Robin Hood Calculator is an interactive visualization tool. In this
        visualization you can see how income is distributed in the world, and
        you have the possibility to tax different income brackets or the ten
        richest individuals, with the goal of lifting people out of extreme
        poverty. Wealth inequality is an issue that is underestimated by many
        [1, 2], and this tool aims to raise awareness about the problem and help
        individuals understand the extent of the issue.
