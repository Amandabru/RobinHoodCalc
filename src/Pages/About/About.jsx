        The Robin Hood Calculator is an interactive visualization tool. In this
        visualization you can see how income is distributed in the world, and
        you have the possibility to tax different income brackets or the ten
        richest individuals, with the goal of lifting people out of extreme
        poverty. Wealth inequality is an issue that is underestimated by many
        [1, 2], and this tool aims to raise awareness about the problem and help
        individuals understand the extent of the issue.

        This project was proposed by an employee at Gapminder with the aim to
        continue develop their visualization by adding the functionality of income
        redistribution. This visualization has therefore taken a lot of
        inspiration from{" "}

        This visualization has two different types of distribution of income,
        which can be changed with the toggle on top. The calculations for the
        ... visualization simply gives the collected money to the poorest, which
        results in an accumulated peak when you start to move the sliders. The
        calculations use a running average in order to smooth out the curve a
        little. The second calculation is made to prevent such peaks from
        appearing, and distributes the collected money in such a way that it
        goes first and foremost to the poorest, but controls the appearence of
        the chart, making the curve smoother. For exact calculations, please
